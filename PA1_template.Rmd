## Loading and preprocessing the data
library(dplyr)
unzip("activity.zip")
activity=read.csv('activity.csv')
activity$date=as.Date(activity$date)
activ2=subset(activity,!is.na(activity$steps))

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
mean(activity$steps, na.rm=TRUE)
library(plyr)
act2=ddply(activity, .(date),summarize, mean=mean(steps))
plot(act2$steps.per.day~act2$date, type='l', xlab='Date',ylab='Total Steps per Day')


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
